# pocketbase-docker

**Note**: pocketbase doesn't allow you to create admin in one off script except migrations. So default admin email and password are `admin@example.com` and `adminexample` respectively. Please add a new admin and remove this default one.

> However this default credentials work around will be removed once we have the new PR that handles this issues gets merged
